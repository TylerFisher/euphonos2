Some songs make you work for the moment you love. It&rsquo;s why you listen to two minutes of a Wayne Shorter improvisation, waiting for him to blow your mind when he pulls out a reference to the Star Wars theme, but you only catch it if you are paying attention.

Other songs — probably the majority of pop music — follow a formula. You know when the payoff is coming. The predictable euphoria of EDM (here comes the drop!) has made it a mainstream success because it follows a formula not unlike other pop music. You don&rsquo;t have to work for the powerful moments; you anticipate and prepare for them.

If it sounds like I&rsquo;m being snooty towards pop music, I&rsquo;m not. And while this seems like a rockist versus poptimist argument, sometimes the expected is just the right thing. Cymbals Eat Guitars&rsquo; &ldquo;Warning&rdquo;, off their 2014 album *Lose*, succeeds entirely on the strength of <span class="soundcite" data-start="0" data-end="" data-url="/assets/audio/warning_chorus.mp3">its chorus</span>, which comes at just the right time, with just the right drive. 

Cymbals Eat Guitars are the type of band that wants you to pay attention. They want you to listen to the intricacies in the interplay between guitar parts and dig deep into the music. But they know when they have to reach out and grab you. Between the subtle modal switch that catches the ear and vocalist Joseph D&rsquo;Agostino&rsquo;s transition from a croon to an outright wail, &ldquo;Warning&rdquo; grabs you by the throat. For a band that has long appealed to the rockist crowd, it&rsquo;s perfect pop music.
